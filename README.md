## Summary
A drawback of this webpage is that the search criteria is sensitive to punctuation. If "CA" was entered instead of "ca," there would be no search returns. A recommendation for additional development is to make it so that the search criteria is not case-sensitive. Another recommendation is add or edit the shape search criteria so it has the ability to search for the color of the lights. There are many instances in the comments column where people has seen red lights, green lights, orange light, and etc. This can help users narrow down their searches.
